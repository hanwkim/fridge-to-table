# Fridge To Table

The purpose of this app is to give users recipe ideas based on ingredients they have in their fridge (or pantry!). It utilizes a free recipe API called [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php).

The repository for the server can be found [here](https://github.com/hanwkim/fridge-to-table-api).

This app was designed and built during a 24hr pair programming hackathon. It was a great way to become more familiar with utilizing web APIs, and a great way to learn through close collaboration.

# Installation

Run ```npm i``` in order to install the necessary dependencies.

Run ```npm start``` to start up the app. Ensure the server is running as well.

# Instructions

Use the search bar to enter in any ingredients, and it will generate a list of recipe ideas. Click a recipe to get the ingredients and cooking instructions, as well as an embedded YouTube video that shows the cooking process.

Conversely, click the fridge on the home page, and it will give three random ingredients on the left, and three random recipes on the right to get you started. Enjoy!
